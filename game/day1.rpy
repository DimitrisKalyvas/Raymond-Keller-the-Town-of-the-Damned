    #SFX- distant city noises
    #Sprite R- Molly (Sad)
    #Bottom Sprite- Ray (Anxious)
    m "You're firing me?!"
    "I hate it when Molly cries."
    "The problem is that she's very good at faking it. I've seen her turn on the waterworks at the drop of a hat."
    r "I'm sorry, Molly. But the fact is that 'Raymond Keller's Supernatural Detective Agency' is on its last legs. We can't keep taking cheap, difficult work like the last one…"
    #CG- Looking at a picnic bench in a park. There is blood and destruction everywhere. The table is in splinters. It had clearly been hosting a birthday party, a few blood splattered balloons are still tethered to the remains of the table, reading 'Happy 6th Birthday Billy!'. Molly is kneeling over a bleeding little boy, hands glowing as she does magic. In the middle of the screen is a very angry looking unicorn. Its horn is covered in blood, its muzzle is covered in cake, and there's a destroyed birthday cake at its feet. It's glowering at Ray, horn lowered, ready to charge. Ray is looking terrified and holding a butterfly net.
    #SFX Police sirens

    #	Angry horse noses.
    r "Oh god, how the hell was the zoo stupid enough to not put magic-proof locks on the unicorn enclosure?!"
    r "Oh shit, it's gonna charge— Molly, help me!"
    m "Sorry Ray, I'm a little busy trying to make sure Billy here sees his seventh birthday!"
    #SFX Horse braying
    #    Thudding hooves
    r "Oh holy fuuuu—"
    #CG Ends
    r "*Shudder* Every time I see a birthday cake, I get flashbacks. And we only got a couple hundred bucks from it."
    #Bottom sprite- Ray (Moody)
    r "Just 'cos we have the word 'supernatural' in the company name, doesn't mean we can deal with everything magical! They should have just called animal control!"
    #Bottom sprite- Ray (Sad)
    r "*Sigh*I can't pay rent for this office. They've turned the lights off at my apartment. I ain’t got no choice but to dissolve the business."
    m "No, Ray! You can't! You— you've got to fight—"
    r "There's nothing I can do! Oh please, cut the tears, we both know you're faking it!"
    m "How can you say that? First you fire me, now you tell me I'm not allowed to cry?"
    r "You're faking it!"
    m "You're heartless, Ray!"
    "Oh crap. Maybe she ain't faking it."
    r "Look Moll, it ain't my fault! We've got those big corporations flooding the market, and we've got those terrible fake reviews – another one was put up today!"
    "I fumble awkwardly with my phone to pull it out of my pocket and get Yelfup."
    #Bottom Sprite- Ray (Angry)
    r "Listen to this BS –"
    r "'I hired Mr Ray to rid my family of a banshee. He took my money, did some cleansing ritual and vanished. But the howling freakis still here – now we're down $300 and I haven’t slept for the last three weeks because of the damn wailing!'"
    r "Now, we ain't had a banshee call since last year, and that customer was more than happy with our services! I've asked the site to take 'em down, but they're taking their sweet time, and I reckon it's too late. I'm sorry, Molly!"
    "As she sobs in my chair, I can't stop my eyes from wandering around the room, snagging on the framed newspaper clippings I had hung up;"
    "'New detective exorcizes the ghost of theBannerworth Museum'."
    "'Rising star of the supernatural detective world vanquishes the vampire of Moulteen'."
    "They were some great cases."
    "They were good times."
    "And now, like a damned fool, I've lost it all."
    #Sfx- Phone ring
    "The sound of the phone ringing from Molly's office breaks me out of my thoughts."
    #Sprite Bottom- Ray (Neutral)
    r "Can you get that, Moll?"
    m "You're a cad, Ray."
    "She gets up and leaves the room, slamming the door behind her, muffling the sound of her sobs."
    "I sigh as I get to my feet."
    "I should pack some boxes."

    #Open ‘Box Pack Game’
    #The scene looks over Ray's desk. There's a cardboard box at the side. Player clicks objects on the desk, which shows them in close up, then clicks on the box, which puts it in the box.
    #Objects include-
    #-	Bunch of pens in a goat's skull- Description: r Just normal pens. The skull? Oh, that was from a ceremony where a bunch of idiots tried to summon Satan. Silly coots. Poor Gertrude the goat here was the ceremonial sacrifice.
    #-	Stapler- Description: r Just a stapler.
    #-	Crystal ball- Description: r I may have stolen this from a High Witch who was trying to make a love spell to seduce Chris Hemsworth. Can't say I blamed her.
    #-	Pack of Tarot cards- Description: r "Oh god, the owner of these was one of the first people to try and hire me. Poor Madam Serpens. May she rest in peace. Or pieces."
    #-	Picture of three young boys hanging out in a tree- Description: r "Me, Benny, and Sam from back at school."
    #-	Magic wand- Description: r Oh, this belonged to a mage who was trying to assassinate the president. He was a real prick- the mage, not the president. I ain't going to comment on him. Wand makes for a good backscratcher though.

    "Buzzz!"
    "My intercom buzzes to life."
    m "*Sob*. Hey Ray, I've got Benny on line one for you. *Sob sob*."
    r "Oh. Thanks."
    "Benny. My childhood friend."
    "I don't know whyhe's calling on my office phone- he's got my mobile."
    "I pick up the phone."
    b "Hey Ray! Raymond! My main man Ray!"
    r "Hey Benny, how you been?"
    b "Oh peachy! You?"
    r "Uh… yep. Yeah. Just dandy. Anyway, what can I do for you?"
    b "Well, I've got a job for you!"
    r "A… a job? Where?"
    b "Well, uh… here. In Rackston."
    #Bottom Sprite- Ray (Moody)
    r "Benny, you know how I feel about that place."
    "I can't even say that name of my hometown. I left it when I was eighteen and ain't been back since."
    "Not even for my folks’ funerals."
    b "I know, I know, but just hear me out! Rackston keeps being attacked by ghouls!"
    #Bottom Sprite- Ray (Curious)
    "That makes me pause."
    r "Ghouls?"
    b "Yeah. Someone's been raising the dead! Only like two or three at a time. I asked my mom – the mayor—"
    r "Yes, Benny, I know your mom's the damned mayor."
    b "Well, I've gotten her to agree to give you the case. It’s yours if you want it."
    r "Benny, I don't—"
    b "And the price tag is nothing to sniff at."
    "This catches my attention."
    r "Oh yeah? How much?"
    b "Five hundred thousand, on completion of the case."
    #Bottom Sprite- Ray (shocked)
    r "Jesus Christ!"
    b "That's the standard fee for 'The Dead Busters'. And I told Mom you were a hundred times better than them."
    #Bottom Sprite- Ray (neutral)
    "I'm tempted. So damn tempted. If I take this job, it might just save the business. But—"
    r "I can't do it, Benny. I can't go back."
    b "I think there's one thing that might just change your mind."
    "God, he's not listening… I'm not sure what I should do. I could try convincing him by being nice. He's my friend- he should listen to me, right?"
    "Or I could just treat him like a normal customer. Not exactly friendly but nether is pressuring me to take this case. Or I could just yell at him…"

    r "I-I don't remember you ever having been to our office."
    b "No, haha. You never invited me. I had to do a bit of snooping on your social media!"
    m "That's not creepy at all. Is that a papier-mâché goat skull?"
    r "Well, uh… it's nice of you to go to all this trouble, Benny."
    b "Any time! I just really want you to be comfortable."
    r "But didn't you get in trouble with your landlord? You must have done some serious redecorating!"

    #Sprite R- Molly (Neutral)
    #Sprite L- Benny (Neutral)
    b "Of course, Ray! Well, long story short, three places in town have been attacked over the last week; the mayor's – my mom's – office,the sheriff's officeand the library."
    b "Or was Mom’s office the last one – can’t remember. Anyway, at the library, a bunch of books were torn apart. At Mom's office, her secretary's computer was smashed, and at the sheriff's place, another computer was smashed, his deputy’s."
    b "Luckily no one's been killed–yet - the bastards have only appeared at night when there's not many people around."
    r "Yeah, ghouls de-animate when the sun comes up."
    b "Ahh. Well, one person, one of the sheriff’s deputies, has been hurt, and they've caused quite a lot of damage."
    b "So as not to cause too much panic, we've been telling the citizens that it was done by vandals. Only Mom, the sheriff and some of his men know the truth."
    r "Right. I'll need to have a look at the scenes."
    b "Sure. They've all been left exactly as they were, ready for you. Maybe you should also talk to Sam. You know, interrogate the prime suspect?"
    #Bottom Sprite- Ray (Awkward)
    r "Uh, no. Not just yet. It's too soon."

    "He pulls out a plastic zipper bag from one of the desk’s drawers and holds it out to me."
    "There are three objects in it."
    #Benny's Evidence
    #The image is three things in a plastic bag. When you click on each, it gives you information.
    #OBJECT 1
    #Description-Hair the same colour as Sam's, tied up in a red ribbon
    #Information given- "A lock of purple hair, tied up in a red bow. Sam's hair changed that colour a few years back thanks to his elves’ blood, according to his Instachat...that I absolutely didn't stalk."
    #OBJECT 2
    #Description-A game card in the style of Pokémon or Magic the Gathering
    #Information given-"An old Fire Phoenix Battle card –that's a fancy shiny Ice Fire Phoenix. Sam got one back when he was collecting in school."
    #OBJECT 3
    #Description-A necklace with a pretty blue heart-shaped locket on it. When clicked, it opens to show an elf woman and a human man- Sam's parents.
    #Information given-"A heart-shaped locket... My breath catches in my throat – this was his mother's locket. Or it had been hers, many, many years ago. I'd never seen Sam take it off, not since the day she pressed it into his hand while he cried over her hospital bed."
    b "They're all his, right?"
    #Bottom sprite- Ray (Thoughtful)
    r "Um. You found these at the scene?"
    b "Uh-huh. The hair was found at the library, the card was at the sheriff’s office, and the necklace at Moms."
    r "That's strange."
    #Sprite L- Benny (Confused)
    b "What?"
    r "He's a smart guy. You'd think he wouldn’t leave such easily identifiable things at a crime scene. Part of the process to summon a ghoul is to give it an item that's important to you... an anchor- but surely he would have found a way to grab them afterwards."
    #Sprite L- Benny (Neutral)
    b "I don’t know. Anyway, we should start checking out scenes before it gets too late-"
    #Sprite R- Molly (Serious)
    m "Not yet."
    #Sprite L- Benny (Moody)
    b "What? Why not, what's wrong?"
    m "I need to meditate."
    b "WHAT? What bullshit is that?"
    m "Again- I. Am. A. Witch. My whole power relies on nature. And I don't know the nature here. I'm not in tune with it. To use my magic, I have to get in touch with nature  every day."
    m "I need access to my magic at all times during an investigation. So, before we do everything- I need to find somewhere to meditate."
    b "Jesus. Not such an amazing set of powers you got there if you got to meditate every day."
    "Molly looks Benny up and down, judgment in her eyes."
    m "Maybe you should try it, Benny. Think it would really… benefit you. Fix your whole vibe."
    "I fight off a laugh as Molly turns and leaves before Benny can muster a comeback."
    #Sprite R leaves.
    #Sprite L- Benny (Angry)
    b "BITCH!"
    r "You deserved that."
    #Sprite L-Benny (Smiling)
    b "Listen, Ray— you know, we could just go without her. We've got lots to do that we don't need her weird magic for, like interrogating suspects."
    #Sprite L- Benny (Curious)
    b "Have you got a strategy in mind for the questioning?"
    #Bottom sprite- Ray (Neutral)
    r "Same one as I always do."
    b "Yeah?"
    r "Well, there are a few possible ways youmight want a suspect to feel about you."
    r "First, you can try and get them to trust and respect you as a professional. Be a peace-maker, seem smart and 'adult'. Be bold. Be honest. Straightforward."
    r "Make them trust in your competence;if they're innocent, they'll help you,feel safe around you. But if they're guilty, seeming smart and competent will usually make them up their game... they might try and get rid of you."
    r "Next, you can try to be their friend. You get on their good side, get them to want to help you. If they're innocent, they might go out of their way to lend a hand in the investigation– but of course, the flip side of that is that it puts them in danger."
    r "If they're guilty, sometimes it makes them drop their defences, makes 'em slip up. But it can be dangerous– you think you're getting under their defences, butreally, they're getting under yours."

    "For a few minutes, the wolf considers me wearily, as if deciding whether to trust me or not."
    "Then she gives a thoughtful little huff."
    w "*Huff* Fine. If you are so curious, I will tell you. But watch that curiosity of yours, Witch. Many a brother and sister have followed their own curiosity, only to have it lead to them becoming ensnared."
    "Well that's something I can definitely relate to."
    m "Thank you sister- your advice is good- I will remember it."
    w "Good. But here is my pack’s story. Heed it well. It all began many years ago, when my mother’s mother’s mother was barely more than a cub. This is her story. She still lived with her parents and brethren. One day, they smelt another wolf in their territory."
    w "They tracked him down and found a male. But rather than fight, he begged them to listen to him. He spoke of the hardship her pack faced in theirold territory- competing for food and hiding from humans and their fire sticks."
    w "He said that he knew a place he could take them where they would be safe, and have plenty of prey. My foremother's father was very suspicious of this too-perfect promise."
    w "But she… one look at this stranger, and she knew she would follow him to the ends of the earth. He was strong, but clever- the cleverest wolf she had ever met. So she begged her father to listen. And eventually, he agreed."
    w "The stranger eventually convinced three packs to follow him to this promised land. It was a long and painful journey- hiding by day, sneaking through the strange, busy human territories by night. It was terrifying."
    w "But over the journey, the stranger and my foremother fell in love and became mates. Eventually, the three packs reached this land. And at first, all seemed perfect. Prey was plentiful and easy to catch."
    w "Occasionally a wolf would be killed by one of the humans' sticks, but it was rare enough that we could manage. For my foremother, life seemed like a dream. Her mate was sweet and kind and protective, and when they had pups, he was a wonderful father."
    w "Except for one thing: he was barley there during the time of the light, while she slept. He usually returned soon after she woke to hunt, but when she woke during the middle of the light time, his side of the den was cold."
    w "And sometimes, when he was there, he'd be… different. None of that intelligent spark. More aggressive. Obsessed with the hunt. And then he wouldn't remember what happened during those times."
    w "So, one day, my foremother decided to follow him after the lighting of the sky, and see where he was. It's hard to stalk a wolf like you'd stalk pray. But our line have always been excellent hunters."
    w "She followed him through the shadows of the forest, until they reached some land that the humans had grown tall thin shining bushes around, to keep creatures out. He went through a gap, and as she watched through the hedge, she saw the most terrible thing."
    w "As the light struck him, he began to change. He struggled and writhed, as if in pain, as his legs got longer, his face flattened. The pads of his paws distorted and stretched. His fur seemed to pull back into his body. Until there stood not her mate, but a human."
    w "He gathered some of the removable pelts you humans ware, and walked off as my poor, foolish foremother tried to make sense of what she had seen. Eventually, after the creature was left, she gathered the energy to return to the woods."
    w "Although she wanted to crawl back into her den with her pups- his pups, and forget all about what she had seen, instead she went to the dens of all the other packs in the forest and gathered all the adult wolves that had once followed this not-wolf into this land."
    w "She told to them what she saw, and at first they did not believe her. But then they smelt her fear. Saw the horror in her eyes. And agreed to follow her and let her prove what she had seen."
    w "So, together, they went to the land she had seen her mate's transformation and hid amongst the trees around the tall metal bushes. They waited all through the light time, until the safety of the darkness descended again, and they saw a human approach."
    w "A human who smelt of the wolf. They watched in horror as the man turned back into their brethren. But when he tried to leave the metal bushes enclosure, out stepped my foremother and the other wolves from the trees."
    w "They told him that if he dared try to show his face near any of their dens again, they would rip him apart. He was not a wolf, and not their brother.  The not-wolf begged them to listen, insisted that he was one of them, more one of them than one of the humans."
    w "But the wolves felt too deceived- they had trusted him, followed him far from their old den, and he was not even a true wolf. He went to my foremother- asked for her to listen, to think of the love they shared- and the cubs."
    w "And she struck him. Bit deep into his neck until blood from her mate dribbled into her mouth. Terrified and heartbroken, he ripped himself free and fled. They never saw him again."
    w "As for my foremother- life was difficult, raising her pups alone. No other wolf would come near her pups if they could help it- for they were his pups too. Sometimes, as they grew, she'd wake up during the light time and find the den empty."
    w "She'd go outside and there they would be, staring up at the moon’s bright brother, as we gaze at the moon. They were smart too, like their father. She'd find them too close to the human territories, watching them curiously."
    w "Of her five pups, only one found a mate, as most were too scared to go near them. And from the litters that came from that coupling, only one wolf reached adulthood, as the prey dwindled, and the humans and their fire sticks crept into the woods more and more."
    w "And many of my blood fell to the allure of your people. And they were shot. And some just disappeared. The single surviving wolf of that line had only one litter- my litter."
    w "And of them, most have died or disappeared. The other packs have died out too. I am the last wolf left from the families the not-wolf brought here. And the last of his dependents."
    w "Although many generations have diluted his blood in my body, I still feel it- the lure of the moon’s bright brother, the call of the humans and their strange above ground dens that reach as high as trees."
    w "When my final hunt is over, my body given over for the prey to feast on, it gives me peace to know that no more of the not-wolf’s children will walk this earth."
    w "Sometimes, at the height of the light-time, I think I can feel him. In my blood. My heart. Longing to stretch out my paws until they lengthen. Pull myself up on my hind legs and reach up a high as I can. To feel the wind on my bare skin, free from fur."
    w "It's wrong to want these things. Unnatural. That urge will die with me."
    "Finally, the wolf falls silent, giving me time to mull over her story. It sounds like, many years ago, her pack encountered… no. No, they couldn't have. They're an incredibly regulated group of people. No way one could live out here."
    "But… it is very isolated…"
    "Well, dogs can have vivid imaginations. Maybe wolves can too. But I probably shouldn't tell her that. Remember- respectful."
    m "Thank you for telling me your pack’s story. I am sorry for the pain of your past."
    w "Remember the tale, Witch. Remember that the face a stranger shows to you can be a well-made lie. And you never know what's behind it."
    m "Thank you, sister. I will not forget your advice."
    w "I need to go. The more time I spend in the light, the more I can feel the unnatural desire to… change."
    m "Go in peace, sister. In spite of your family's past, I wish you well. May your hunts be plentiful. May you always find fresh water. And when your time is done, may the earth accept your remains with open arms as you return to the mother of all life."
    "The wolf cocks her head at me."
